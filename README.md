## Problem:


I am a teacher and every year we have overnight excursions where we have to organize rooms for around 100 students.
However there are a number of requirements when organise these rooms:

Boys and girls MUST be in seperate rooms
Room sizes and amount of rooms will vary. e.g. 
This year we might have 4x '5 bed' rooms and 7x '4 bed' rooms, however, 
we may have restrictions on this so all the boys rooms are together etc..
Each student allocates 3 students they would like to share with,
and we promise to get them at least 1 of their friends.
